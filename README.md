How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
    To keep programs maintainable, readable, and adaptable, there are a few things to keep in mind when writing the programs. We would need to add functionality to keep it current. The easiest way to add updates is to keep things modular for better reusability. We want to avoid rewriting things when returning to old programs to update and add new features.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    
    As a computer scientist, when I look at a problem, I will take a step back and see the big picture, focusing on the end goal and finding a path to achieve that. For the Grazioso requirements, I started by doing what I knew I could do first starting at the base level and gradually working up to the more challenging portions. This kept things manageable and progressing at a steady rate.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
    
    A computer scientist is good at solving problems. They find solutions and develop and maintain software to help companies achieve their goals. They are the main people responsible for expanding the world from within a computer. This benefits a company by creating and maintaining their software to help customers and give their company access to a new market of users for their systems.
